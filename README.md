# Bechdel Test on Spanish Films

## Project description
✏️ - 

🛠 - Jupyter Notebooks have been used because of their ease of use and convenience for exploratory data analysis, along with the Python language.
🚩 - The main challenge was to find the necessary data on Spanish films, as there was no database with such information. Therefore, CSV files have been created, through web scraping, containing this information.

## How to use the project
There is no executable, as this is an exploratory data analysis. The notebook with the analysis and the functions to scrape the information about the films can be found in the "src" folder.
The CSV-files with the scraped information can be found in the folder "data".
